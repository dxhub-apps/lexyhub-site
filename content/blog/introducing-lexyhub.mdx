We built LexiHub because we were frustrated with the existing tools available for marketplace sellers. Traditional keyword research tools rely on exact matching, miss emerging trends, and force you to juggle multiple expensive subscriptions.

## The Problem with Traditional Tools

If you're an Etsy, Amazon, or multi-platform seller, you know the pain:

- **Manual Research Across Multiple Tools**: You're paying for 3-4 different subscriptions, manually cross-referencing data, and still missing opportunities.
- **Exact Matching Only**: Traditional tools only find keywords you already know about. They can't help you discover related niches or understand semantic relationships.
- **Late to Trends**: By the time mainstream tools show a trend, it's already saturated.
- **No Validation**: Single-source data means you can't tell if a trend is real or just noise.

## Our Approach: AI + Multi-Source Validation

LexiHub takes a fundamentally different approach:

### 1. Semantic AI Search

We use 3,072-dimensional AI embeddings to understand *meaning*, not just exact phrases. Search for "handmade candles" and discover related opportunities like "artisan wax melts" or "aromatherapy home decor" that competitors miss.

This isn't just synonym matching—our AI understands buyer intent, product relationships, and market context.

### 2. Multi-Source Trend Validation

We aggregate data from 5+ sources:
- Etsy marketplace data
- Amazon search trends
- Google Trends
- Pinterest trends
- Reddit discussions

Cross-validation reduces false positives and helps you catch opportunities before they hit mainstream tools.

### 3. Seasonal Intelligence

Our platform automatically weights keywords for seasonal events like Black Friday, Christmas, Mother's Day, and more. Plan your inventory 2-3 months ahead of demand peaks.

### 4. Market Twin Simulator

Model "what-if" scenarios before making changes:
- Test price adjustments and see projected revenue impact
- Forecast inventory needs for seasonal peaks
- Compare best-case vs. realistic outcomes

### 5. Listing Intelligence

Get AI-powered quality audits that score your listings and provide specific, prioritized fixes:
- Readability analysis
- Keyword density optimization
- Sentiment scoring
- Completeness checks
- Tag health and substitutions

- **Affordable Scaling**: Basic ($6.99), Pro ($12.99), or Growth ($24.99)
- **Chrome Extension**: Get insights directly on Amazon, Etsy, or Google
