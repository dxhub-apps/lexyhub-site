          <h1>We sell. We stare at data. We hate guessing.</h1>
          <p>
            LexyHub was built by marketplace operators who have actually fought for the Buy Box, got penalized for wrong
            inventory bets, and watched a trend peak before the report arrived. We wired every data source we wanted into one
            interface and made it explain itself.

            <h2>Origin story</h2>
            <p>
              We ran multi-marketplace catalogs. Amazon, Etsy, D2C. Every week the same problem: signals were everywhere,
              timestamps were off, teams were reacting late. So we built a commerce-grade signal layer.

            <h2>What we’re obsessed with</h2>
            <p>Complete, time-aligned, explainable data.</p>
            <ul class="feature__list">
              <li>Real marketplace search, not proxies</li>
              <li>Momentum scored against saturation</li>
              <li>AI briefs that show their work</li>

              <li>Chasing spikes without stock</li>

            <h2>Our non-negotiables</h2>
            <p>
              No black-box signals. No 30-day-old “insights.” No charts that don’t tell you what to launch or drop. If it
              doesn’t move GMV or launch velocity, we rip it out.

            We have sat in the 10 p.m. “are we buying this or not” call. We have overbought on a trend that was already decaying.
            That is why LexyHub exposes signal age, source, and confidence.

              Scaled marketplace revenue. Lived the pain of reconciling Amazon keyword jumps with Etsy buyers and D2C ops.
              Started LexyHub to kill that swivel-chair work.

              Tracks cultural shifts against actual SKUs. If TikTok says it’s hot but Amazon says it’s flat, she shows you the
              gap.
